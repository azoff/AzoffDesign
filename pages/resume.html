			<h2>RentJuice</h2>
			<div class="sub">
				<h3>Software Architect / Developer</h3>
				<em>March 2011 - Present</em>
			</div>
			<p>
				At RentJuice, I enjoy a senior role as software architect - managing and developing atomic verticals for our emerging product feature set. One such vertical I chaperoned, The Facebook and website widget product, enabled property managers and landlords to expand their reach to new media. The project received a fair bit of press, some of which can be found <a href="http://azof.fr/l3FmmY">here</a>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				 In addition to consumer facing features, I also created several tools used internally to improve workflow and minimize regressions as the product grew. For instance, I developed, deployed, and managed the internal continuous integration (CI) framework, which I built using Java and the open-sourced <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.html">Selenium WebDriver</a> toolkit. After developing the framework, I also managed hand-off and training of the CI framework with the quality assurance department.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, I still manage the aforementioned projects, and I continue to build out the core product with a great team.

			<h2>Playdom</h2>
			<div class="sub">
				<h3>Software Architect / Developer</h3>
				<em>January 2010 - March 2011</em>
			</div>
			<p>
				At Playdom, my primary function is building and maintaining the social-network integration framework for games coming out of the San Francisco studio. I packaged the framework into a reusable SDK, which Playdom uses to rapidly create social games, on an agnostic platform.
			</p>
			<p>
			    I leveraged this framework to help develop <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/marketstreet">Market Street</a>, a highly successful game that runs agnostically on several leading social networks. While it was the first game to come out of our San Francisco studio, Market Street was surprisingly Playdom's DAU (Daily Average User) leader within weeks of its launch. As a result of its unexpected popularity, I was fortunate (or unfortunate depending on your experience) enough to experience the growing pains of a rapidly scaling application. This experience put me in a position to build tools, and establish practices, that gave us a greater visibility into Market Street as it worked in production. Consequentially, we were able to quickly react to problems users where seeing on the live application, and respond accordingly.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Finally, I was at Playdom during the The Walt Disney Company's acquisition and transition into the Disney Interactive Media Group. Besides being an amazing experience, and putting Playdom in the news, the buyout showed me what it takes to compete in the "Social Gaming" space.

			<h2>Pixelpipe</h2>
			<div class="sub">
				<h3>Lead Designer / Software Developer</h3>
				<em>July 2009 - January 2010</em>
			</div>
			<p>
				My role at Pixelpipe ranged anywhere from backend ops to front-end design. I got to work with many social APIs and integrated them in ways 
				that targeted extensibility and growth. As a result of being part of a small team, I was able to lend
				a hand in many parts of a distributed, social web-application. However, the most important benefit of being able to work at all levels of the
				stack, was that it allowed me to come up with consistent methods of handling scalability. As a result of this hands-on experience, I was able
				to better recognize the ripple effect, for instance the effect memcaching at the data layer has on AJAX methods in the user-interaction layer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pixelpipe helped me learn that being a "specialist" is not always a good thing. Admittedly, without the help of a great CTO, I would have not
				been able to learn this on my own. I was able to implement production code in a host of programming languages, including Python and Java. In
				addition, I was able to develop a mobile service extension for Pixelpipe, on the Palm WebOS platform. It was my first attempt at building a
				mobile app, and actually <a href="http://precentral.net/best-apps-2009">won a award</a> for one of the best Palm apps of 2009.

			<h2>Campus Kiwi</h2>
			<div class="sub">
				<h3>Software Architect / Developer</h3>
				<em>June 2009 - September 2009</em>
			</div>
			<p>
				CampusKiwi was the first job I landed out of college after my senior year. CampusKiwi was started by a classmate, and only existed as an outsourced
				proof-of concept when I arrived. Together, with the help of a small product team, I helped to implement a new user interface, as well as clean up 
				existing security issues and bugs. Most of my work was done in some part of the LAMP stack, but I had a particular focus in code-reuse and separation
				of concerns
			</p>
			<p>
				These days, I mostly work as a consultant for CampusKiwi, helping where and when I can.

			<h2>Xillent Studios</h2>
			<div class="sub">
				<h3>Lead Web Developer</h3>
				<em>September 2007 - June 2009</em>
			</div>
			<p>
				I consider Xillent my first real programming job. I started as a part-time intern my sophomore year of college, and by the time I was graduating, I
				had moved up to the position of lead developer. I worked mainly using Microsoft web technologies (ASP/ASP.NET) which, in retrospect, gave me a good
				idea of their strengths/weaknesses vs. open-sourced technologies. I also developed ads and a video player in flash in addition to my regular work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Besides being a programming job, Xillent also gave me my first experiences managing myself and others. Most of my projects were time-boxed, so
				development with a team was a concerted effort. It was an effort I personally failed at multiple times before gaining the confidence to manage
				projects on my own. These days, I owe most of my confidence in my self-management to the experience I gained from Xillent.

			<h2>Astreya Partners</h2>
			<div class="sub">
				<h3>Tech Stop Administrator</h3>
				<em>April 2007 - September 2007</em>
			</div>
			<p>
				I worked for Astreya during the summer between my freshman and sophmore year of college. When I applied, I had no idea what Astreya was, other
				than a recruiting agency for ops talent. Having a short history in ops, I applied and was surprised to find out that Astreya was currently contracted
				by Google to handle operations in Google's Mountain View office. I was promptly stationed in Mountain View, participated in training, and became a
				full-fledged "Tech Stop Administrator" by mid-summer.
			</p>
			<p>
				My roles as a Tech Stop Administrator included standard operations tasks such as internal DNS management, hardware fulfillment, and tech service for
				the engineers in the building I worked in. Astreya was a great experience, and though it did not help me much as a developer, it solidified my
				troubleshooting skills and whet my appetite for working in the silicon valley tech industry.

			<p>
				Working for my alma mater was a personal first attempt at applying my educational focus to my vocation. My primary roles included helping students
				with technical problems, running anti-virus software on infected computers, and maintaining the student computer lab. I also wrote a custom script
				suite that automated the task of running anti-virus on computers and generating reports.<br/>

				I started work at Accessory Genie as a market researcher, but slowly transitioned into a graphic design role through a small affinity for Photoshop.
