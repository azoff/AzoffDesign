	<p class="font-geneva color-dark-gray">
	Azoff Design is the brain-child and design portfolio of Jonathan Azoff (Me!). For mostly selfish reasons, I started
	this site as a repository for my code and projects. However, the experience of sharing code online has had
	unexpected influences on my reasons for updating this site. Its almost like a feel-good, charitable hobby that gives
	back every time I produce a piece of code. In the future, I hope for this site to continue living as a repository
	for my code, but with the concentrated aim of giving back to developers like myself. Heck, even this site is even
	<a href="http://github.com/azoff/AzoffDesign">open sourced</a>!

	<h2 class="font-canarsie-slab color-black">Who is Jonathan Azoff?</h2>
	<p class="font-geneva color-dark-gray">
	I am a web-developer, graphic designer, software architect and human being living in the city of San Francisco.
	I attended college at the University of Santa Clara, and graduated in the summer of 2009 with a Bachelors of Science
	in Computer Engineering. Outside of programming, I read far too much, play adult rec-league sports, and enjoy life
	with my friends and family. As I continue my career, I hope to grow as both a professional developer and
	contributor to open-source technology.

	<h2 class="font-canarsie-slab color-black">Do you do freelance work?</h2>
	<p class="font-geneva color-dark-gray">
	I wish I could categorically say 'no', but I am too much of a dreamer to deny that the right project might not
	coerce my imagination. However, when taking freelance into account, I always consider my
	<a href="resume">current employment status</a> and existing non-compete agreements.

	<h2 class="font-canarsie-slab color-black">How can I get in touch?</h2>
