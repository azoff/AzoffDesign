	<p class="font-geneva color-dark-gray">
	Azoff Design is the brain-child and design portfolio of Jonathan Azoff (Me!). Starting as an over-architected web-application,
	it has since morphed into a <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress Blog</a>, and is now living now as
	a project-driven, <a href="http://appengine.google.com">App-Engine</a> portfolio. Mostly for selfish reasons, I started this
	site as a repository for my code and projects. However, the experience of sharing code online has had unexpected influences on
	my reasons for continuing development on this site. Its almost like a feel-good, charitable hobby that gives back every time
	I produce a piece of code. In the future, I hope for this site to continue living as a repository for my code, but with the
	concentrated aim of giving back to developers like myself. Heck, even this site is even
	<a href="http://github.com/azoff/AzoffDesign">open sourced</a>!.

	<h2 class="font-canarsie-slab color-black">Who is Jonathan Azoff?</h2>
	<p class="font-geneva color-dark-gray">
	I am a web-developer, graphic designer, software architect and human being living in the city of San Francisco.
	I attended college at the University of Santa Clara, and graduated in the summer of 2009 with a Bachelors of Science in 
	Computer Engineering. Outside of programming, I tend to read a lot, blog, and enjoy life with my friends and family. I'm no athlete,
	but I also spend time playing organized sports with my friends and co-workers, and have recently discovered an affinity for ping pong.
	As I continue my career, I hope to grow both as a professional developer and as a contributor to open-source technology.

	<h2 class="font-canarsie-slab color-black">Do you do freelance work?</h2>
	<p class="font-geneva color-dark-gray">
	I wish I could categorically say 'no', but I am too much of a dreamer to deny that the right project might not coerce my imagination.
	However, when taking freelance into account, I always consider my <a href="resume">current employment status</a> and existing non-compete 
	agreements before making any decisions.
