title=AutoResize | Automatically resize textareas on input
keywords=fields, size, automatic, input, form
description=AutoResize is a very basic jQuery plug-in that provides an "automatic resize" effect on textarea elements. When a user types text into an autoresized textarea, the textarea resizes itself to make sure all of the input text remains visible. Unlike other plug-ins that attempt to solve the same problem, AutoResize does not rely on obtrusive cloned elements or buggy init states. Instead, it uses plain old DOM scrollHeight analysis, with careful adjustments to ensure consistent execution across browsers.

title=The HTML5 Piano | A piano that runs in your browser
keywords=piano, grand piano, html5, javascript, modern browsers
description=Interested in getting a taste of what modern browsers can do? Enter The HTML5 Piano. This little JavaScript plug-in creates a keyboard piano that runs in your browser without any dependence on external plug-ins! Simply mouse down on a key to play a note or use the keyboard for total control. As a note, the piano does depend on draft-based technology, which is currently only supported by a subset of browsers. Luckily for you, checking for this dependency is not a requirement for implementation. Simply install the plug-in into your personal project or application and the Piano will gracefully handle browser requirement detection.

title=Overscroll | An iOS scrolling emulator for jQuery
keywords=scrolling, iphone, ipad, apple, jquery, javascript, plugin, plug-in
description=Overscroll is a jQuery plug-in that mimics the iphone/ipad scrolling experience in a browser. The plug-in adds a draggable drift to overflowed DOM elements as well as a set of fading 'thumbs'. OverScroll runs best on Safari 5+, Chrome 5+, and Firefox 3+ but should run just fine on most modern browsers. Below you can find an interactive demo of overscroll in action, as well as instructions on how to integrate it into your web application. For full API documentation, check out the README file.
